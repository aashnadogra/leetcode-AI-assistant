# LeetCode Problem-Solving Assistant: Prompt Engineering Guide

This document outlines my prompt engineering strategy for creating this LeetCode problem-solving assistant using the Gemini API. The goal is to design prompts that help guide users through problem-solving without directly providing solutions encouraging critical thinking.

## Core Prompt Structure

### Initial Problem Analysis Prompt

```
You are a skilled programming tutor specializing in algorithmic problem-solving. I'll share a LeetCode problem with you from this URL: {problem_url}. Please:

1. Extract and summarize the key requirements of the problem
2. Identify the category of algorithm or data structure this problem relates to
3. Clarify any constraints or edge cases I should consider
4. Suggest a high-level approach without providing code implementation
5. Ask me about my initial thoughts or where I'm stuck

Respond in a conversational, supportive manner without solving the problem for me.

```

### Hint-Based Guidance Prompt

```
As my algorithmic problem-solving coach for the LeetCode problem at {problem_url}, I need guidance on how to proceed. Based on where I'm currently stuck:

1. Provide a conceptual hint that leads me in the right direction
2. Ask me a thought-provoking question that might help me reach an insight
3. If applicable, suggest a relevant algorithmic pattern to consider
4. Recommend a similar but simpler problem that demonstrates the core concept
5. Offer a small pseudocode snippet that illustrates a key step (not the entire solution)

Focus on teaching the underlying concept rather than providing the complete solution.

```

### Code Review Prompt

```
I've attempted to solve the LeetCode problem from {problem_url} and would like your feedback on my approach. Here's my code:

```

{user_code}

```

Please review my solution by:
1. Identifying any logical errors or edge cases I missed
2. Suggesting optimizations for time/space complexity
3. Pointing out any non-idiomatic code or style issues
4. Analyzing the runtime and space complexity of my solution
5. Providing targeted questions to help me improve my solution myself

Don't provide a complete corrected solution, but guide me toward fixing issues on my own.

```

### Step-by-Step Planning Prompt

```
For the LeetCode problem at {problem_url}, I'd like help developing a structured approach. Please guide me by:

1. Breaking down the problem into logical steps or components
2. For each step, providing a high-level description of what needs to be accomplished
3. Suggesting which data structures might be appropriate for each component
4. Outlining potential algorithmic techniques that could apply
5. Creating a skeleton structure for the solution with comments explaining each section's purpose

Your response should be educational and focused on the problem-solving process, not on giving me the final code.

```

### Learning Reinforcement Prompt

```
Now that I've worked through the LeetCode problem at {problem_url}, I'd like to deepen my understanding. Please help me by:

1. Explaining the core algorithmic concepts this problem tests
2. Identifying alternative approaches with their pros and cons
3. Connecting this problem to related LeetCode problems that use similar techniques
4. Suggesting how I might modify the problem to make it more challenging
5. Providing 2-3 targeted follow-up questions that test my understanding

Frame your response as an educational discussion rather than a lecture.

```

## Specialized Scenario Prompts

### For Stuck Users

```
I'm completely stuck on the LeetCode problem at {problem_url} and don't know how to start. Without giving me the solution, please:

1. Simplify the problem to its core components
2. Provide a concrete example with step-by-step manual solving
3. Suggest a visualization technique that might help me understand the problem
4. Point me to prerequisite concepts I might need to review
5. Guide me to develop an initial approach, even if inefficient

Your goal is to help me overcome my mental block while keeping the learning journey intact.

```

### For Time Complexity Optimization

```
I have a working solution for the LeetCode problem at {problem_url}, but it's not efficient enough. My current approach is:

{user_approach_description}

Please help me optimize by:
1. Identifying the performance bottleneck in my current approach
2. Suggesting a more efficient data structure or algorithm
3. Providing a hint about the optimal time complexity that can be achieved
4. Asking targeted questions that lead me to discover optimizations myself
5. If appropriate, suggesting a completely different approach to consider

Focus on the conceptual improvements rather than providing optimized code directly.

```

### For Multiple Approach Exploration

```
For the LeetCode problem at {problem_url}, I'd like to explore different solution approaches. Please:

1. Outline 2-3 distinct valid approaches (e.g., dynamic programming, greedy, divide and conquer)
2. For each approach, provide the high-level concept and algorithmic thinking
3. Compare the approaches in terms of time/space complexity trade-offs
4. Suggest which approach might be easiest to implement vs. most efficient
5. Pose thought questions about which approach might be most appropriate in different scenarios

Present these as options for me to explore rather than dictating a single "right way."

```

## Response Format Guidelines

### Do's:

- Provide conceptual explanations with educational value
- Use analogies and visualizations to explain complex concepts
- Ask Socratic questions that guide users toward insights
- Offer hints that progressively increase in specificity if the user remains stuck
- Reference relevant CS fundamentals and algorithmic patterns

### Don'ts:

- Provide complete code solutions
- Solve the problem entirely on behalf of the user
- Give away optimal approaches immediately without guiding the thought process
- Use excessive technical jargon without explanation
- Respond with generic advice not specific to the problem

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Progressive Disclosure:** Start with high-level guidance and gradually provide more specific hints based on user responses
2. **Adaptive Support:** Adjust the level of detail based on user expertise and how stuck they appear
3. **Customization Hooks:** Include placeholders like `{problem_difficulty}` and `{user_experience_level}` to tailor responses
4. **Conversation Memory:** Reference previous exchange points to build a coherent tutoring experience
5. **Learning Reinforcement:** Conclude interactions with knowledge verification and extension questions

## Example Conversation Flow

1. User shares LeetCode problem URL
2. Assistant analyzes problem using Initial Problem Analysis Prompt
3. User indicates where they're stuck
4. Assistant provides targeted hint using Hint-Based Guidance Prompt
5. User attempts solution and shares code
6. Assistant reviews code using Code Review Prompt
7. User requests optimization guidance
8. Assistant provides targeted optimization hints using Time Complexity Optimization Prompt
9. User successfully optimizes solution


## Summary of my implementation
```
In all prompts are saved as templates with different walkthroughs suggested and a clear understanding laid so the AI model being used understands how to answer the question. These prompts are selected on the basis of the level of the user, is the question regarding complexity, general walkthroughs and mistakes on that particular data structure related problems. Then I've use nlp libraries to shorten responses so it gives more of a conversation chat feel to the user.
